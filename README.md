Hi Everyone I am building a Asp.net core Project where i have used a clean Architecture for a White lagoon Website where it is filled with advanced concepts.
White lagoon website is filled with advanced concepts where customers can view the villa Rooms in Resort and making Bookings.
Admin can view the Bookings and View the summary on their dashboard while managing all the villa via CMS that i build for admin Users.
